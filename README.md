Journal Editorial Task Helper

## Description
I created this program to facilitate all the manual work I do at my part-time job as a journal editorial assistant. So far, it is an interactive console application that is able to store and update the reviewer/article data, auto-generate the quarterly editorial and expenditure reports, and generate email bodies based on the status of the reviewing process. I plan on including more features and improving usability as I continue learning new tools. I will also update and report any bugs fixes.
